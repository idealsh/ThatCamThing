## 🚀 How to Use

Integrating `ThatCamThing` into your SwiftUI view takes just a few steps.

### 🧩 Step 1: Import the Library

```swift
import ThatCamThing
```

---

### 🔐 Step 2: Add Camera Permissions

In your `Info.plist`, add:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera for capturing photos.</string>
```

---

### 📸 Step 3: Use `CameraView` with Defaults

The library provides default overlay and error views to get started quickly:

```swift
CameraView()
    .setOverlayScreen(DefaultCameraOverlay.init)
    .setErrorScreen(DefaultCameraErrorView.init)
```

---

### 🎛️ Customizing Camera Attributes

To customize the camera behavior, you can configure `CameraManagerAttributes`:

```swift
CameraView()
    .setOverlayScreen(DefaultCameraOverlay.init)
    .setErrorScreen(DefaultCameraErrorView.init)
    .setAttributes(CameraManagerAttributes(
        cameraPosition: .back,
        frameRate: 60,
        flashMode: .auto,
        resolution: .hd4K3840x2160,
        lensType: .wide
    ))
    .onImageCaptured { image in
        // Handle captured UIImage
    }
```

---

### 🧪 Custom Overlays

You can customize the UI by providing your own views:

#### ✅ Custom Overlay Screen

To use your own camera overlay, conform to the `CameraOverlay` protocol:

```swift
struct MyOverlay: CameraOverlay {
   
}
```

#### ❗ Custom Error Screen

To display a custom error view, conform to the `CameraErrorOverlay` protocol:

```swift
struct MyErrorView: CameraErrorOverlay {
    
}
```

Then apply them like this:

```swift
CameraView()
    .setOverlayScreen(MyOverlay.init)
    .setErrorScreen(MyErrorView.init)
```
